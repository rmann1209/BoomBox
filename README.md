# Spotify-Whatever

PROJECT NAME: BoomBox

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project will be a sort of "letterbox" for music. Users who create an account can link their personal spotify account, which will then display to them their top songs, artists, and albums. Users can also follow other users using either their BoomBox or spotify account name. Users may then rate and/or comment on any songs, artists, or albums they so choose, which can be viewed by any other users who follow them. There will also be a search function that will allow users to search for specific songs or artists and see ratings left by the people they follow.
