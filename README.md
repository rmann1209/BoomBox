BoomBox

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project will be a sort of "letterbox" for music.  Users can also follow other users using their BoomBox . Users may then rate and/or comment on any songs, artists, or albums they so choose, which can be viewed by any other users who follow them. There will also be a search function that will allow users to search for specific songs or artists and see ratings left by the people they follow.
